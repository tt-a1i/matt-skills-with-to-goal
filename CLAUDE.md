Skills are organized into bucket folders under `skills/`:

- `engineering/`: daily code work
- `productivity/`: daily non-code workflow tools
- `misc/`: kept around but rarely used, not promoted
- `in-progress/`: beta: public on purpose, feedback wanted, not shipped in the plugin
- `deprecated/`: historical source excluded from default distribution; old human docs live under `docs/archived/`

Every skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/` (the **promoted** buckets) must have a reference in the top-level `README.md` and an entry in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`'s `skills` array (the Claude Code plugin ships exactly the promoted set). Skills in `misc/`, `in-progress/`, and `deprecated/` must not appear in either.

Install commands are copied verbatim from [.agents/install-block.md](./.agents/install-block.md). `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` makes this fork its own single-plugin marketplace. Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` after touching either manifest. The upstream managed-install evidence and this fork's distinct installation routes live in [.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md](./.agents/adr/0002-ship-as-a-claude-code-plugin.md).

Each skill entry in the top-level `README.md` must link the skill name to its `SKILL.md`.

Each bucket folder has a `README.md` that lists every skill in the bucket with a one-line description, with the skill name linked to its `SKILL.md`. The promoted buckets' `README.md`s and the top-level `README.md` group entries into **User-invoked** and **Model-invoked**; non-promoted bucket `README.md`s (`misc/`, `in-progress/`) use a flat list.

Skills in `engineering/` and `productivity/` also have a human-facing docs page at `docs/<bucket>/<skill-name>.md` (the docs tree mirrors those two bucket folders under `skills/`). The published URL is `https://aihero.dev/skills-<skill-name>` regardless of bucket: the docs path is repo organisation only. When you add, rename, or change the behaviour of a skill in `engineering/` or `productivity/`, create or re-sync its docs page following [.agents/writing-docs.md](./.agents/writing-docs.md). A finished page carries four sections: **What it does**, **When to reach for it**, **Common questions**, and **It's working if**. `writing-docs.md` holds the template, the section order, and where to hunt for the questions. Skills in the non-promoted buckets (`misc/`, `in-progress/`, `deprecated/`) get **no** docs page.

Every `SKILL.md` is either user-invoked (`disable-model-invocation: true` plus `policy.allow_implicit_invocation: false` in `agents/openai.yaml`, reachable only by the human) or model-invoked (model- or user-reachable). See [.agents/invocation.md](./.agents/invocation.md).


To (re)link every skill outside `deprecated/` and `misc/` into the local harness skill directories (`~/.claude/skills`, `~/.agents/skills`), run `scripts/link-skills.sh`. Each entry is a symlink into this repo, so a `git pull` keeps installed skills current; re-run the script after adding, removing, or renaming a skill.

Rejected directions get archived, not merely decided. When this fork turns down a skill direction or a design — its own calls, not only upstream feature requests — record it in `.out-of-scope/` under the convention `triage` already follows ([skills/engineering/triage/OUT-OF-SCOPE.md](./skills/engineering/triage/OUT-OF-SCOPE.md)): one file per concept, kebab-case concept name. The reason must be durable — scope, mechanism, or cost, never a temporary circumstance, because a decision resting on the current moment is a deferral rather than a rejection. Never record something that was in fact built; a false rejection poisons the concept matching that makes the directory worth reading.

Before syncing upstream, publishing to `origin`, or refreshing local installs, read [docs/maintaining-fork.md](./docs/maintaining-fork.md). It covers review merges, bounded diff inspection, skill/doc consistency, and validation before publication.

Use plain punctuation in repository prose, consistent with upstream: rewrite sentences with commas, colons, periods, parentheses, or conjunctions.
